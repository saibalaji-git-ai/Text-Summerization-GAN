―Every day, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data — so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone. This data comes from everywhere: sensors used to gather climate information, posts to social media sites, digital pictures and videos, purchase transaction records, and cell phone GPS signals to name a few.‖[1]. such colossal amount of data that is being produced continuously is what can be coined as Big Data. Big Data decodes previously untouched data to derive new insight that gets integrated into business operations. However, as the amounts of data increases exponential, the current techniques are becoming obsolete. Dealing with Big Data requires comprehensive coding skills, domain knowledge and statistics. Despite being Herculean in nature, Big Data applications are almost ubiquitous- from marketing to scientific research to customer interests and so on. We can witness Big Data in action almost everywhere today. From Facebook which handles over 40 billion photos from its user base to CERN‘s Large Hydron Collider (LHC) which generates 15PB a year to Walmart which handles more than 1 billion customer transactions in an hour. Over a year ago, the World Bank organized the first WBG Big Data Innovation Challenge which brought forward several unique ideas applying Big Data such as big data to predict poverty and for climate smart agriculture and fore user-focused Identification of Road Infrastructure Condition and safety and so on [2]. Big Data can be simply defined by explaining the 3V‘s – volume, velocity and variety which are the driving dimensions of Big Data quantification. Gartner analyst, Doug Laney [3] introduced the famous 3 V‘s concept in a. Volume: This essentially concerns the large quantities of data that is generated continuously. Initially storing such data was problematic because of high storage costs. However with decreasing storage costs, this problem has been kept somewhat at bay as of now. However this is only a temporary solution and better technology needs to be developed. Smartphones, E-Commerce and social networking websites are examples where massive amounts of data are being generated. This data can be easily distinguishes between structured data, unstructured data and semi-structured data.
b. Velocity: In what now seems like the pre-historic times, data was processed in batches. However this technique is only feasible when the incoming data rate is slower than the batch processing rate and the delay is much of a hindrance. At present times, the speed at which such colossal amounts of data are being generated is unbelievably high. Take Facebook [5] for example – it generates 2.7 billion like actions/day and 300 million photos amongst others roughly amounting to 2.5 million pieces of content in each day while Google Now processes over 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide.[6].
c. Variety: Documents to databases to excel tables to pictures and videos and audios in hundreds of formats, data is now losing structure. Structure can no longer be imposed like before for the analysis of data. Data generated can be o any type- structures, semi-structured or unstructured. The conventional form of data is structured data. For example text. Unstructured data can be generated from social networking sites, sensors and satellites.
Implementing Big Data is a mammoth task given the large volume, velocity and variety. ―Big Data‖ is a term encompassing the use of techniques to capture, process, analyze and visualize potentially large datasets in a reasonable timeframe not accessible to standard IT technologies. By extension, the platform, tools and software used for this purpose are collectively called ―Big Data technologies‖. [7] Currently, the most commonly implemented technology is Hadoop. Hadoop is the culmination of several other technologies like Hadoop Distribution File Systems, Pig, Hive and HBase. Etc. However, even Hadoop or other existing techniques will be highly incapable of dealing with the complexities of Big Data in the near future. The following are few cases where standard processing approaches to problems will fail due to Big Data-
 Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST): ―Over 30 thousands gigabytes (30TB) of images will be generated every night during the decade –long LSST survey sky.‖ [8]
 There is a corollary to Parkinson‘s Law that states: ―Data expands to fill the space available for storage.‖[9]
 This is no longer true since the data being generated will soon exceed all available storage space.[10][8]
 72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute.[11]
There are at present two general approaches to big data-
a. Divide and Conquer using Hadoop: The huge data set is broken into smaller parts and processed in a parallel fashion using many servers.
b. Brute Force using technology on the likes of SAP HANA: One very powerful server with massive storage is used to compress the data set into a single unit.
Big Data is slowly becoming ubiquitous. Every arena of business, health or general living standards now can implement big data analytics. To put simply, Big Data is a field which can be used in any zone whatsoever given that this large quantity of data can be harnessed to one‘s 
advantage. The major applications of Big Data have been listed below.
 The Third Eye- Data Visualization
Organizations worldwide are slowly and perpetually recognizing the importance of big data analytics. From predicting customer purchasing behavior patterns to influencing them to make purchases to detecting fraud and misuse which until very recently used to be an incomprehensible task for most companies big data analytics is a one-stop solution. Business experts should have the opportunity to question and interpret data according to their business requirements irrespective of the complexity and volume of the data. In order to achieve this requirement, data scientists need to efficiently visualize and present this data in a comprehensible manner. Giants like Google, Facebook, Twitter, EBay, Wal-Mart etc., adopted data visualization to ease complexity of handling data. Data visualization has shown immense positive outcomes in such business organizations. Implementing data analytics and data visualization, enterprises can finally begin to tap into the immense potential that Big data possesses and ensure greater return on investments and business stability.
 Integration- An exigency of the 21st century
Integrating digital capabilities in decision-making of an organization is transforming enterprises. By transforming the processes, such companies are developing agility, flexibility and precision that enables new growth. Gartner described the confluence of mobile devices, social networks, cloud services and big data analytics as the as nexus of forces. Using social and mobile technologies to alter the way people connect and interact with the organizations and incorporating big data analytics in this process is proving to be a boon for organizations implementing it. Using this concept, enterprises are finding ways to leverage the data better either to increase revenues or to cut costs even if most of it is still focused on customer-centric outcomes. Such customer-centric objectives may still be the primary concern of most companies, a gradual shift to integrating big data technologies into the background operations and internal processes.
to have the maximum social impact. Right from the diagnosis of potential health hazards in an individual to complex medical research, big data is present in all aspects of it [12]. Devices such as the Fitbit [13], Jawbone [14] and the Samsung Gear Fit [15] allow the user to track and upload data. Soon enough such data will be compiled and made available to doctors, which will aid them in the diagnosis. Several partnerships like the Pittsburgh Health Data Alliance have been established. The Pittsburgh Health Data Alliance [16] is a collaboration of the Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh and the UPMC. In their website, they state [16], ―The health care field generates an enormous amount of data every day. There is a need, and opportunity, to mine this data and provide it to the medical researchers and practitioners who can put it to work in real life, to benefit real people……The solutions we develop will be focused on preventing the onset of disease, improving diagnosis and enhancing quality of care…….Further, there is the potential to lower health care costs, one of the greatest challenges facing our nation. And the Alliance will also drive economic growth in Pittsburgh, attracting hundreds of companies and entrepreneurs, and generating thousands of jobs, from around the world…‖The patients diagnosis will be analyzed and compared with the symptoms of others to discover patterns and ensure better treatment. IBM [17] has taken initiative in a large scale to implement big data in healthcare systems be in its collaboration with healthcare giant Fletcher Allen or with the Premier healthcare alliance to change the way unstructured but useful clinical data is made available to more medical practitioners so as to improve population health. Big Data can also be used in major clinical trials like cure for various forms of cancer and developing tailor-made medicines [12] for individual patients according to their genetic makeup. To summarize, Sundar Ram of Oracle stated [18], ―Big Data solutions can help the industry acquire organize & analyze this data to optimize resource allocation, plug inefficiencies, reduce cost of treatment, improve access to healthcare & advance medicinal research.‖
 Big Data and the World of Finance:
Big Data can be a very useful tool in analyzing the incredibly complex stock market moves and aid in making global financial decisions. For example, intelligent and extensive analysis of the big data available on Google Trends can aid in forecasting the stock market. Though this is not a fool-proof method, it definitely is an advancement in the field. A research study [19] by the Warwick Business School drew on records from Google, Wikipedia and Amazon Mechanical Trunk in the time period of 2004-2012 and analyzed the link between Internet searches on politics or business and stock market moves. In the paper, the author states, ―We draw on data from Google and Wikipedia, as well as Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results are in line with the intriguing possibility that changes in online information-gathering behavior relating to both politics and business were historically linked to subsequent stock market moves….Our results provide evidence that for complex
